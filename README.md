# Subtleous

## Concept

The idea is an evolving gradient between random points that are associated with a specific colour. Each point will form a gradient between each of the points and the background colour. All points should have a loose relationship with each other based on colour theory and transparency. The colour of each point, as well as the background, will slowly evolve causing the entire canvas to be in a constant state of evolution.


## Running it

```sh
npm i
npm start
```


## Status 

So far this is just the start of the sketch. Nothing animating yet.
